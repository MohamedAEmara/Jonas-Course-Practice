there are two types of packages, "dependencies" & "devDependencies" 
The first one, our application depends on it 
but the second one, we use it just to develop out application.

To specify that some package is for development  ===>  use "--save-dev" after package name

After we install some node modules, we will find that there is a folder added "node_moudles"
that includes all dependencies of our application,
There is many dependencies that we didn't install, but some of them are dependencies of the installed dependencies.
------
To install some package globally on your machine so that you don't have to reinstall it on your future projects.
    $ npm i <package-name> --global
